/* trying to understand c main function from assembly code  via gdb */

% - memory regsiters
$ - constant values in hex

rbp - base pointer
rsp - stack pointer

/* first line of 101-crackme main in assembly */

1. save current base pointer
2. make base pointer point to current stack entry
3. reserves 32 bytes on stack
5. stores %edi -20 bytes from rbp (current base pointer)
6. store %rsi -32 bytes from rbp

call function with return value
